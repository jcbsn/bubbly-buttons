# Bubbly Buttons
Bored of normal border-radius? 
Here's a simple way to generate a more joyful box.

## Inspiration
I was one day scrolling through the feed of dribbble and found these button. They weren't normal buttons. They had a border radius, that much was obvious, but they had something more. This left me wondering. What's so special about these buttons? How can I make these with CSS? These guys have probably made them with some design tool I've never heard of.

After doing some research I found that I couldn't make them with CSS. Atleast not according to my understanding.
SVG path seemed like a promising workaround.

## Prototype
I would like to give a huge thanks to [Anthony Dugois](https://codepen.io/anthonydugois/) for making the [SVG Path Builder](https://codepen.io/anthonydugois/pen/mewdyZ). 

I reached the result I wanted with the path tool.
